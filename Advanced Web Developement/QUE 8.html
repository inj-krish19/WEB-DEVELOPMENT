Pokémon[a][1][2][3] (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters[b] in Japanese) is a Japanese media
 franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.
The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered around fictional creatures called "Pokémon".
 In Pokémon, Pokémon Trainers are people who catch, train, care for, and battle with Pokémon.
 The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All!".[5][6] There are currently 1015 Pokémon species.[7]

The franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), 
a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. 
Pokémon soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media.[8] Pokémon is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. 
The Pokémon video game series is the third best-selling video game franchise of all time with more than 440 million copies sold[9] 
and one billion mobile downloads.[10] 
The Pokémon video game series spawned an anime television series that has become the most successful video game
 adaptation of all time[11] with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 192 countries.
 [9] The Pokémon Trading Card Game is the highest-selling trading card game 
 of all time[12] with over 43.2 billion cards sold. In addition, the Pokémon franchise includes
 the world's top-selling toy brand,[13] an anime film series, a live-action
 film (Detective Pikachu), books, manga comics, music, merchandise, and a temporary theme park. 
 The franchise is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series,
 where various Pokémon characters appear as both playable and non-playable characters.</p>

<p>Ash Ketchum, known as Satoshi (サトシ) in Japan, is a fictional character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo,
 Game Freak, and Creatures. He is the protagonist of the Pokémon anime for first 25 seasons and certain manga series 
 as well as on various merchandise related to the franchise. In Japanese, the character is voiced by Rika Matsumoto. 
 Hana Takeda voices six-year-old Ash in episode 1 of Pokémon Journeys: The Series. In the English dub, he was voiced 
 by Veronica Taylor in the first eight seasons and has been voiced by Sarah Natochenny since season 9.
Ash is a young man who travels with various companions, aiming to fulfill his dream to become a Pokémon Master; 
his Pokémon lineup greatly evolves over the course of the series, with its sole constant member being Pikachu,
 the only character besides Ash to remain part of the series for its entirety. Ash is loosely based on Red, 
 the player character from the Generation I games Pokémon Red, Green, Blue and Yellow as well as their remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen.
Ash Ketchum was first mentioned in a video game at the dialogue of Pokémon Play It!, and his first appearance in a game was in Pokémon Puzzle League. 
Satoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pokémon, with whom Ash shares his Japanese name, has stated that Ash represents the 'human aspect' of the series, 
and that Ash reflects what he himself was like as a kid.[3] As the protagonist of the Pokémon anime, 
Ash has appeared in almost all episodes of the anime and all the films.
Due to the huge popularity, success, and longevity of the Pokémon anime series around the world since its debut,
[4] Ash has gone on to become one of the most well-known and recognizable fictional characters of all time[5][6] 
due to his status as the protagonist of the Pokémon anime.[7] However, he is often overshadowed in series 
representation by the franchise mascot, Pikachu. Despite this, Ash, along with others from the series,[8] 
is considered a pop culture icon, and a figurehead character of the wave of anime in the late 1990s; 
which is credited by most anime fans as having popularized anime in the west, alongside others such as 
Goku of Dragon Ball Z, Yugi of Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Sailor Moon of the show of the same name.
 He is also considered a major icon for Japanese pop culture in the United States.

<p>Pikachu[a] is a fictional species in the Pokémon media franchise. 
Designed by Atsuko Nishida and Ken Sugimori, Pikachu first appeared in the 1996 Japanese video games Pokémon 
Red and Green created by Game Freak and Nintendo, which were released outside of Japan in 1998 as Pokémon Red and Blue. P
ikachu is a yellow, mouse-like creature with electrical abilities. 
It is a major character in the Pokémon franchise, serving as its mascot and as a major mascot for Nintendo.
Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species, 
largely due to its appearance in the Pokémon anime television series as the companion 
of protagonist Ash Ketchum. In most vocalized appearances Pikachu is voiced by Ikue Ōtani,
 though it has been portrayed by other actors, notably Ryan Reynolds in the live-action 
 animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu. Pikachu has been well received by critics, 
 with particular praise given for its cuteness, and has come to be regarded as an icon of Japanese pop culture.
 Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996, 
 and features several species of creatures called "Pokémon" that players, called "trainers",
 are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pokémon or interact with the game's world.
 [5] Pikachu was one of several different Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team.
 Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's design,[6][7]
 which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori.[8][9] According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, 
 the name is derived from a combination of two Japanese onomatopoeia: ピカピカ (pikapika), 
 a sparkling sound, and チューチュー (chūchū), a sound a mouse makes.[10] Despite its name's 
 origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's original design, especially its cheeks, on squirrels.
 [11] Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult to create, 
 due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences.[12]
